// v1.0, 2015-10-04

We are going to create the following effect:

image::3d-flipping.gif[3D flipping effect]

The link is a normal button style until you mouse over on it. When hover, the button flips 360 degree. When the mouse moves out, the button return to is original position in a smooth pace.

== Step 1—Defining the HTML

[source,html]
----
<div class='button3d'> <1>
  <a href='#' class='button'>Hover me</a>
</div>
----
<1> The container to preserve the hover effect.

== Step 2—Add the basic style

[source,css]
----
a {
  text-decoration: none;
  color: #222;
}

.button3d .button {
  display: block;
  padding: 1rem;
  background: GOLD;
  text-align: center;
}
----

== Step 3—Define the 3D flipping effect.

[source,css]
----
.button3d {
  perspective: 600;
  cursor: pointer;
}
.button3d .button {
  transition: all 0.6s ease-out; # <1>
}
.button3d:hover .button {
  transform: rotateX(360deg);
  transition: all 0.3s ease-out; # <2>
}
----
<1> 0.6s when the mouse is out. Slow to make it reverts smoothly.
<2> 0.3s when the mouse is over. Fast to make it looks response.

== Result

== How it works

We have created the effect. Let’s take a look on the key techniques to make it works.

=== 3D rotating

The rotation is done by the `rotateX` transform.

----
transform: rotateX(360deg);
----

Why X-axis?

The following graph shows the coordination of the screen. In order to create the 3D rotating effect, we actually rotate around the X-axis.

=== The container

The container is essential for the hover to work.

Imagine when we hover on the a link, we rotate the link. During the rotation, the effective area of the link actually reduces.

So even the mouse doesn't move, the hover styles are removed because the mouse is no longer over on the area of the link.

In order to address this issue. We need a container to wrap the link.

Then we apply the hover selector on the container. In this case, the effective area doesn't change during the animation.
